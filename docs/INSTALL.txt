collective.classifieds Installation
==========================

(please read the crossover release section below!)

To install collective.classifieds into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:

 * When you're reading this you have probably already run 
   ``easy_install collective.classifieds``. Find out how to install setuptools
   (and EasyInstall) here:
   http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

 * If you are using Zope 2.9 (not 2.10), get `pythonproducts`_ and install it 
   via::

       python setup.py install --home /path/to/instance

   into your Zope instance.

 * Create a file called ``collective.classifieds-configure.zcml`` in the
   ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
   should only contain this::

       <include package="collective.classifieds" />

.. _pythonproducts: http://plone.org/products/pythonproducts



Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

 * Add ``collective.classifieds`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:
 
    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        collective.classifieds
        
  * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:
  
    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        collective.classifieds
        
  * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:
  
    $ ./bin/buildout
        
You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.

Remember to rebuild / reindex your portal_catalog when updating a existing installation.
Also check archtype_tool if the schema needs to be updated.
Finally, check the portal_workflow tool if security settings need to be updated



Important information about the 'crossover release':

This release introduces two new contenttypes, which allows you to manual set the order of the items.
This order is introduced in the new contenttypes, not the old ones because this will break them and
all the data will be lost. This is the reason why new contenttypes are introduced.
If you want to migrate your categories and classifieds to the new contenttypes you have to
create a 'Classifieds (with order)' container and add 'Category (with order)' items there.
After that you can cut and paste the classifieds in the correct categories.
